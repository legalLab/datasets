Integrative taxonomy reveals a new species of pacu (Characiformes: Serrasalmidae: _Myloplus_) from the Brazilian Amazon. _Neotropical Ichthyology_. [https://doi.org/10.1590/1982-0224-20190112](https://doi.org/10.1590/1982-0224-20190112).

## Abstract

Pacus of the genus _Myloplus_ represent a formidable taxonomic challenge, and particularly so for the case of _M. asterias_ and _M. rubripinnis_, two widespread and common species that harbor considerable morphological diversity. Here we apply DNA barcoding and multiple species discovery methods to find candidate species in this complex group. We report on one well-supported lineage that is also morphologically and ecologically distinct. This lineage represents a new species that can be distinguished from congeners by the presence of dark chromatophores on lateral-line scales, which gives the appearance of a black lateral line. It can be further diagnosed by having 25-29 branched dorsal-fin rays (vs. 18-24), 89-114 perforated scales from the supracleithrum to the end of hypural plate (vs. 56-89), and 98-120 total lateral line scales (vs. 59-97). The new species is widely distributed in the Amazon basin, but seems to have a preference for black- and clearwater habitats. This ecological preference and black lateral line color pattern bears a striking similarity to the recently described silver dollar _Metynnis melanogrammus_.
